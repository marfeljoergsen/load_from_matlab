Visualization - OpenGL - Wind Turbine model


# Wind Turbine Visualization

This is Python-code for visualization of wind turbine forces calculated in Matlab, as part of my PhD-project "Aerodynamic and Mechanical System Modelling", at Technical University of Denmark during the years 2010-2013 - my thesis can be found online, however the thesis does not completely describe this project. This code illustrates how to work with OpenGL (rotations, translations etc) and 3D geometries, including conversion to/from Euler angles/quaternions.

## Getting Started

This Python- project runs standalone, it will not install locally as no installer is included. Some text files ("*.txt") are used to adjust scaling and coordinate system locations of the individually used CAD files.


### Prerequisites

The packages "python2-scipy" and probably "python2-pygame/python2-pygame-sdl2" and "python2-opengl" + maybe other stuff is needed. When you try to run, Python will complain if you do not fullfill the needed dependencies. In this case you need to continue to install what you need, e.g.:

```
apt-get install (package-name you need, check your console for error messages)
yum install (package-name you need, check your console for error messages)
pacman -S (package-name you need, check your console for error messages)
```


### Running the program

When all dependencies are satisfied, you should be able to run the program using e.g. "python2.7 main.py" (only tested on Linux). The program will open up an OpenGL window with some info/statistics about what it's doing:

### Other comments

There are no unit-tests or similar in this package. This has been a stand-alone exercise for me to learn more about 3D OpenGL coding, coordinate transformations etc and I'm sure it can be improved many places if I had more time. I also believe some years prior to putting this project here, this code ran at around 60 FPS - instead of only 4 FPS. I have not investigated this issue. The intention of the project was only to visualize some Matlab results and make a small library for 3D operations.
